# Demo

Convoy Panel has demos available for you to try out. The demo is a full-featured version of Convoy Panel, but with some
limitations. The demo is reset regularly, so changes will not persist. However, this instance of Convoy is volunteer-run
so please be respectful of the resources available.

## Credits

Thanks to `DeathInTokio` on Discord for providing the demo instance!
